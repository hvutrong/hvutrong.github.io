## Hoa T. Vu
I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/). 

My current research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms with a focus on problems that arise in streaming and distributed settings. Some topics include graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and sketching algorithms. 

For more details, check out my [research papers](papers.html), [CV](CV.pdf), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3qZIn8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Brief bio: I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Andrew McGregor](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/).  I also spent a year as a postdoc at Boston College, working with Prof. [Hsin-Hao Su](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedhsinhao/).
